# Cosine Approximation Wهth C#
This program approximates cosine in terms of radians and degrees by using the algorithm of cosine approximation formula with sigma.
## How to work ? 
This code, includes CosApptoximation class that's a static class and append some Extention Methods to Single Types and this methodes are compute the cosine of a angle like follow :  
```csharp
int d = 90; 
﻿Console.WriteLine($"Cosine of {d} degree is : {JCSCos.CosApproximation.DegreeApCos(d)}");
```
With the above code, you will get an output like this:  
```
Cosine of 90 degree is : 0
```
